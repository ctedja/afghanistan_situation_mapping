# Afghanistan Situation Mapping

A sample excerpt of a fully operational emergency dashboard developed end-to-end within R Markdown (flexddashboard). Additional pages overlaying supply chain, dispatch, beneficiary and resourcing data have been omitted.

This excerpt of sample **[code](https://github.com/ctedja/afghanistan_situation_mapping/blob/main/sample_code.Rmd)** is taken almost entirely from open data sources and can be used to generate fully functioning maps which allow for switching between multiple layers. Basemaps have been developed in Mapbox, and since tokens have also been omitted in the code, these would need to be created independently.
